# BD-JB-1250
BD-JB for up to PS4 12.50

This might be the exploit that was reported by TheFlow and patched at 12.52

No this won't work at PS5.

For compiling I recommend using john-tornblom's bdj-sdk

### Credits
[TheFlow](https://github.com/theofficialflow) - for his BD-JB documentation and sources for native code execution

[hammer-83](https://github.com/hammer-83) - for his PS5 Remote JAR Loader, it helped me a lot to learn how BD-J works

[john-tornblom](https://github.com/john-tornblom) - for his BDJ-SDK, I couldn't have compiled PS4 BD-J without his BDJ-SDK
